Chat in Rust
============

A scalable chat service using [WebSockets](https://www.websocket.org/), implemented in [Rust](http://rust-lang.org/).

## About

This repository is my personal implementation based on the blog post [Rust in Detail: Writing Scalable Chat Service from Scratch](http://nbaksalyar.github.io/2015/07/10/writing-chat-in-rust.html) by [Nikita Baksalyar](https://github.com/nbaksalyar) ([@nbaksalyar](https://twitter.com/nbaksalyar)).

The purpose is to learn Rust and a bit more about WebSockets. But mostly Rust.
